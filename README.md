It's a project of sensing the gesture performed with microcontroller in hand the code will detect it.
On board gyroscope is used to monitor gesture.
Any user can use this code and run using mbed library and can make the code learn any gesture of their choice first and then it will start detecting. Just follow the instruction that will be displayed on screen.
Threshold has been kept as low as possible so only accurate repeating gesture will be detected.
